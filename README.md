# Assignment_1_Integrating_Text-to-Text_AI_Pipelines_with_Gradio
My submission for assignment1 of Tuwaiq bootcamp.

I choose an NER model to complete this assignment, simply, my project is to implement a NER model with a gradio interface, and let the user input a text and the outputs should be:
1-the text with a red highlight on the entities, along with their types.
2-A dataframe of the text showing the entities, their types, confidence scores, start positions, end positions and the whole text.
